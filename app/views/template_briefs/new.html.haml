      **Template title** is how you will refer to the template when creating briefs. 
      Enter a **section** (and optionally a **help message**) for each of the sections to appear in briefs based on this template. 
      Add additional sections by clicking **“Add a Section or Heading”**

      You can group related sections together using a **Section Heading**. 
      Create a Section Heading by ticking the **“Is Heading?”** check box.

      Sections and Section Headings can be reordered once the template has been submitted. 
      There is no limit to the number of Sections that you can have.
