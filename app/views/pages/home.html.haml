        // %p The International Exchange is a UK charity based in Brazil that “brings together the world of communications and the world of development in order to achieve social change.”
        // %p TIE uses ideapi to create and collaborate on a clear brief internally before sending it out to agencies in the UK and US to get candidates on to their programmes.
        %p ideapi is "a new tool that is perfect for allowing us to collaborate more efficiently and effectively on all our project briefs and proposals." 
        %p "The easy to use system allows anyone to create their own bespoke templates and invite whoever they wish to work with to join in and co-create - perfect for an organisation like ours working with many different groups and individuals all in different time zones!"
