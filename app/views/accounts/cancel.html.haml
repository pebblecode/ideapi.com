  %p
    You are about to cancel your account. This will
    %strong
      permanently delete all your data.    
    Once you do this, you will no longer have access to your data, so be sure this is really what you want to do.

      Wait!  Before you go...

    %p
      Instead of canceling your account, perhaps you'd like to just switch your plan.
  
    %p  
      %a{ :href => "/account/plan" }
        Change your subscription level now.

  - form_tag :action => 'cancel' do
    %fieldset
      %legend
        Cancel Confirmation
      %p 
        %input.checkbox{ :name => "confirm", :type => "checkbox", :value => "1" }
        I really do want to cancel my account and delete all my data.
