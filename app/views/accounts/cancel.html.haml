    You are about to cancel your account. This will
    %strong
      permanently delete all your data.    
    Once you do this, you will no longer have access to your data, so be sure this is really what you want to do.

  - form_tag :action => 'cancel' do
    %fieldset
      %legend
        Cancel Confirmation
      %p 
        %input.checkbox{ :name => "confirm", :type => "checkbox", :value => "1" }
        I really do want to cancel my account and delete all my data.
