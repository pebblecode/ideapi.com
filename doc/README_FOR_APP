FUCKSOCKS! I was sweeping up after a hard day's work of feeding the penguins and coding ruby
and found that there was no documentation for this application. Imagine the number of developers
that will end up in mental homes if this situation continues? I hope this will make you happy but
most of all I hope the bees do not die. Peanut butter without honey on crumpets would just not be the 
same.

You'll find the code base is largely completely uncommented, unless it has had comments added by me.
If you can, pull out your sword of hope and add some yourself. The best commment wins a cup. 

Please cut the crap and tell me how it works!

OK.

The make_resourceful gem is in use so this affects controllers and views with the ubiquitous use of 
current_object. I'd recommend casting your eyeballs over this page to get down with the plan

Tests

There is a reasonably good test suite in place, although I'm not sure of how much recent development has 
been tested. The test framework uses Machinist for factories, Shoulda and test unit. 

There isn't too much low level stuff - it is mostly integration tests.
