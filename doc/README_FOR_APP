# Installation 

There are a number of pre-requisites to installing ideapi

ideapi makes use of Resque http://github.com/defunkt/resque to queue background jobs. Resque relies on Redis. 
The Resque README provides instructions on installing Redis.

To ensure that workers do not die (bless them) ideapi also uses God http://github.com/mojombo/god. Again
the README for God is comprehensive. The staging and production servers are configured to keep workers 
and Redis alive.

On your development box you will need to have Redis and workers running if you want to use Resque.

To invoke a worker from the root of the rails site you can use the following command

QUEUE=* rake resque:work

To start the Resque GUI run

resque-web
