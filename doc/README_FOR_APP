# Installation 

To install ideapi from scratch, go into the ideapi rails directory:

    # Install gems
    sudo gem install -v=2.3.8 rails
    sudo gem install resque
    sudo gem install haml
    sudo rake gems:install
    
    # Install mysql if required: http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/install-mysql-and-mysql-ruby-gem-on-snow-leopard-64-bit/
    # May need to set the correct permissions for mysql to run properly
    
    # If using homebrew
    brew update
    brew install redis    # Follow post install instructions
        
    # Set up db
    rake db:create    # Required if ideapi db hasn't been created yet
    rake ideapi:bootstrap
    
    
Add this to the /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file, replacing [ideapi directory] with the relevant value:
    
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        <Directory [ideapi directory]>
          Options +FollowSymlinks +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch 
          Order allow,deny
          allow from all
          AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
        DocumentRoot [ideapi directory]/public
        ServerName smackaho.st
        ServerAlias *.smackaho.st
        RailsEnv development
    </VirtualHost>
    
## Resque    

ideapi makes use of Resque http://github.com/defunkt/resque to queue background jobs. Resque relies on Redis. 
The Resque README provides instructions on installing Redis.

To ensure that workers do not die (bless them) ideapi also uses God http://github.com/mojombo/god. Again
the README for God is comprehensive. The staging and production servers are configured to keep workers 
and Redis alive.

On your development box you will need to have Redis and workers running if you want to use Resque.

To invoke a worker from the root of the rails site you can use the following command

QUEUE=* rake resque:work

To start the Resque GUI run

resque-web
